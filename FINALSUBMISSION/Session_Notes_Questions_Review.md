## Current Answers Summary & Improvement Opportunities

### Q1: ELEVATOR PITCH (150 words)
**Current strength**: Clear problem/solution, mentions key stats (73% false positive reduction, 500 acres/hour, $0.60/acre)
**Potential improvements**:
- Lead with the impact/vision rather than "Sylva is..."
- Add emotional hook about environmental impact
- Ensure the "why now" is clearer

### Q2: TEAM (150 words)
**Current strength**: Shows real relationships with agencies, mentions built drones
**Potential improvements**:
- Highlight complementary skills more clearly
- Add a sentence about what makes this team uniquely positioned
- Mention any relevant coursework or prior experience

### Q3: OPPORTUNITY (300 words)
**Current strength**: Good problem framing, mentions $1.1B Clean California
**Potential improvements**:
- Add urgency (regulations, climate deadlines)
- Quantify the gap more specifically (how much is wasted on inefficient surveys?)
- Strengthen the "agencies told us" voice

### Q4: INNOVATION (750 words) - HIGHEST WEIGHT
**Current strength**: Technical depth, spectral signatures, 73% false positive stat
**Potential improvements**:
- Open with the "aha moment" or insight that led to the innovation
- Make the IP protection language more confident ("filing" → "filed")
- Add a sentence about why competitors can't easily replicate
- Clarify what's novel vs. existing tech combined in new way

### Q5: VALIDATION & PROGRESS (450 words)
**Current strength**: Concrete numbers (4 drones, 8 detections, 87% confidence)
**Potential improvements**:
- Add dates to create timeline of progress
- Mention any lessons learned from crashes (shows iteration)
- Quantify the agency feedback (e.g., "3 agencies confirmed interest in pilots")

### Q6: MARKET (300 words)
**Current strength**: Good segmentation, mentions buyer vs. user distinction
**Potential improvements**:
- Add TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown if possible

## Key Statistics to Ensure Consistency

These numbers should match across all materials (questions, website, video):

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Cost per acre (Sylva) | <$2 (or $0.60-1.86) | Business Model |
| Cost per acre (Manual) | $12-18 | Industry standard |
| Coverage speed | 500 acres/hour | Technical specs |
| False positive reduction | 73% | Testing results |
| Detection confidence | 87% | December 2025 test |
| Drones built | 4 | Hardware progress |
| Detections in field test | 8 from 11 images | December 2025 |
| API endpoints | 60+ | Dashboard |
| Flight time | 90 minutes | Drone specs |
| Hyperspectral bands | 8 (900-1700nm) | Camera specs |
| Ocean plastic annually | 8-14M tons | Jambeck et al. 2015 |
| Ecosystem damage | $13B | UNEP 2014, 2023 |
| Clean California budget | $1.1B | Caltrans |
| US remediation market | $24.7B | Precedence Research |

## Tone/Style Guidelines

The answers should maintain:
- **16-year-old high school voice**: Authentic, enthusiastic, not overly corporate
- **Confident but not arrogant**: "We've built" not "We have pioneered"
- **Specific over vague**: Numbers and names over generalities
- **Problem-first**: Show understanding before pitching solution
- **Active voice**: "We ran tests" not "Tests were conducted"

Avoid:
- Jargon without explanation
- Overpromising on timeline
- Sounding like a marketing brochure
- Passive constructions
- Filler words

## Suggested Review Process for Next Session

1. Read each question aloud - does it flow naturally?
2. Check word counts are within limits
3. Verify all statistics match across documents
4. Look for opportunities to add specific names/dates
5. Ensure each answer directly addresses what judges are looking for
6. Check that the Innovation section (30% weight) is the strongest
